## Core workflows

1. **Install SDK** — download the Halo Wars SDK, run the Haruspis launcher, and point the bundler at the installed folders.
2. **Import content** — use the Asset Bundler to import models/textures.
3. **Debug build** — look at the console log during `haruspis build` and refer to the engine tables below for error codes.
